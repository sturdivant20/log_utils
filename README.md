## Installation
Clone the project into desired folder and `cd` into it:

cd log_utils
```

Create a virtual environment or use your base Python environment. For creating a virtual 
environment, refer to 
[this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/). 
Ensure the virtual environment is active in your editor if you decide to use one.

From here, `pip install` the navigator package in editable mode.
```shell
pip install -e .
```

<!-- >**Note:** `pip` may throw an error claiming you cannot install from a `pyproject.toml` file. If 
this is the case, upgrade your version of pip with `pip install --upgrade pip`. -->
